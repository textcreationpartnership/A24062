            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A SUPPLY OF CONSIDERABLE THINGS, In behalf of the GOVERNMENT; Omitted in all the late ARGUINGS. <hi>Written to Sir</hi> J.A.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU know my Thoughts well enough, about what has been late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Written, of the <hi>Engliſh Conſtitution of Government;</hi> but ſeeing I affirm'd ſome things with ſhort Intimations of Reaſons, I owe you this larger Diſcourſe, which yet ſhall be bounded within the compaſs of a Letter. He that wrote againſt <hi>Plato Redivivus,</hi> gave an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent account from Records, of the ancient Exerciſe of our King's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, but hath left <hi>untouch'd</hi> the learned part about the Opinions and Reports from <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> concerning the Seat of Soveraign Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. It muſt be ſaid in behalf of the Anſwerer, that thoſe Conſiderations were of leſs moment; but ſeeing his oppoſite Author (wou'd it may be) rather derive ſomething like a Divine right from thoſe Books than any other; you ſhall ſee how little countenance the Soveraignty of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or of any upper part of them, receives from theſe Philoſophers. <hi>Plato</hi>

(whom he wou'd have alive again in him) ſpeaks in his <hi>Politicus</hi> plain and ſhort of <hi>Monarchy</hi> and <hi>Democracy,</hi> for a certain Reaſon, I will give you his Saying in his Greek, tho' that may make a Letter look like a School-Boys Epiſtle, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Monarchy being joyn'd to good written Laws is the beſt of all Governments, and the worſt of all lawful Governments, is that of the Common People.</hi> I hope he has enough of our <hi>Plato,</hi> into whom that the <hi>Rumper</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viv'd, wou'd be a very good wiſh, but I doubt he and his Fellows will quarrel with theſe Academicks, almoſt as much as they do with our Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity-men for ſpoiling their Pupils with Monarchical Principles; for <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle Plato</hi>'s Schollar talks like his Tutor, for he in this third Book of a <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> treating of Government mixt of <hi>Ariſtocracy</hi> and <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy,</hi> adds his Judgment againſt it; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>But it is better</hi> (ſays he) <hi>that a ſingle Perſon who is careful ſhould have the Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am now to obſerve a more conſiderable error of this Gentleman, who ſeems rather inclin'd to be a Depoſer, than with his Great Name-ſake to be call'd a <hi>Make-King;</hi> he ſays that among the <hi>Jews,</hi> the Supreme Power was not in a Single Perſon. Where was it then, <hi>When the Lord was their King?</hi> upon which account <hi>Joſephus</hi> calls their Government a <hi>Theocracy,</hi> and elſe-where the Single Judges that rul'd, are ſtil'd by him Monarchs; and the Inſtitution of Kingly Government, which was not to begin among them till Almighty Power had ſetl'd 'em in the <hi>Promis'd Land,</hi> was from himſelf; ſo the Charge is given (Deut. 17.15.) <hi>Thou ſhalt in any wiſe ſet him King over thee, whom the Lord thy God ſhall chuſe.</hi> So that the People deſiring afterwards a King, was not evil in it ſelf, but only as to the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuary and diſtruſtful manner, when God was their King, and the Prophet his Deputy, who brought them Orders immediately from the Mouth of God: That the Supream Power was in the King, is plain to thoſe who know the large Prerogatives of <hi>Eaſtern Monarchs;</hi> for like theſe were the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah, the People ſaid we will have a King over us, that we alſo may be like all the Nations.</hi> And God commands <hi>Samuel, Hearken to their Voice, and make them a King;</hi> and the Subjection into which they enter'd was but like that of the Neighbouring <hi>Eaſtern Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> ſo that what we have in the common reading, <hi>the manner of the King</hi> (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.) is well render'd by the LXX <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>the Rightful Law,</hi> a Word us'd by them frequently concerning the Laws of God himſelf. The Affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of things now calls to thought what has been ſaid to and fro about Patriarchs, Whether Monarchy was founded in them and thence Deriv'd.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53888:2"/>
The notion has been improv'd into a juſt and regular diſcourſe, by that Worthy Gentleman Sir <hi>Robert Filmer,</hi> to whom too we are beholden for a Book aſcrib'd to Mr. <hi>Hales,</hi> very convincingly written, concerning the Sin againſt the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> The Argument I would add to his affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive part of the Queſtion, is from the general apprehenſion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who in the midling Ages of the <hi>Roman Emperors</hi> had (tho' they were a <hi>Scatter'd People</hi>) a <hi>Monarch,</hi> under the Name of <hi>Patriarch;</hi> his Monarchy was ſucceſſive in the Family of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> of whom St. <hi>Luke</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>He had about him a Council for Government, and Officers appointed to receive Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute from the</hi> Jewiſh Nation <hi>whereſoever diſpers'd;</hi> a pretty full account of this we have from <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> by Birth a <hi>Jew,</hi> and the reſt is ſupplied from the Civil Law. What that Father ſays of the <hi>Patriarch,</hi> is in the 30th. Hereſy, to wit, of the <hi>Ebionites.</hi> About the ſame time St. <hi>Hierom</hi> ſpeaks of a <hi>Patriarch</hi> as the Supream Magiſtrate of the <hi>Jews,</hi> in his Commentary on <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> ſaying, that in them was fulfill'd what is Propheſy'd in the third Chapter, <hi>I will give Children to be their Princes, and Babes ſhall rule over them.</hi> I lay the more weight upon theſe two Witneſſes, becauſe one by Birth and Education, the other by Study and Converſation, ſo well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood what they ſaid. In the Civil Law we find <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror confiſcating their collected Tribute, and forbidding it to be gather'd hereafter, nor can it be thought that the payments were only charitable Contributions for publick Pious Uſes, for you may read in the ſame Code, that it was demanded as Crown-gold: There are two principal things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood among Learned Men and Civilians, by the <hi>aurum coronarium,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what was payed by Vanquiſh'd Nations to their Conquerors, or with reference to the Crown, to new-created Emperors, let it be one or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſtill it proves that the <hi>Jews</hi> eſteem'd their <hi>Patriarch</hi> to be a ſucceſſive Monarch.</p>
            <p>Another conſiderable thing, of which an account ſhou'd deſervedly be given, is about the <hi>Divine Right</hi> of <hi>Monarchy;</hi> this wants no other defence, but to be rightly underſtood. The Aſſertion has been <hi>Raillery</hi> to a ſort of <hi>Witts</hi> and <hi>Half-States-men,</hi> none of whom ſhew their knowledge of its meaning, for the <hi>Divine-Right,</hi> or <hi>Law,</hi> is either voluntary-divine, or natural-divine: The firſt takes its Original from the Will of God, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther has its Foundation in the neceſſity and inward goodneſs of the thing, upon which God's Will is certainly added; ſo that to ſay without any ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinction, that Monarchy is <hi>jure divino,</hi> is no more than that it is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution accompanied with the Authority of God's Will, and that our Propoſition is true in this large ſence, appears from the 'foremention'd Words in <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> and from that of <hi>Solomon's Proverbs, by me Kings
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53888:3"/>
Reign,</hi> but to reſolve upon whether ſort of <hi>Divine right Monarchy</hi> is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, wou'd be a Subtilty uſeleſs to the Affairs of the World, it being a ſure rule, that whatever carries along with it the approving Will of God, can only by this plaineſt Declaration be taken away or alter'd; ſo that if <hi>Monarchy</hi> did not oblige under the nature of a Moral Law, but as a divine-poſitive one (of which number the Sacraments are) it is ſtill unalterable by Subjects, nay, it may further be ſaid, that a Right meerly humane in its Original, convey'd over to another, is confirmed to the Poſſeſſor and his Heirs by a <hi>natural-divine Right;</hi> this is evident from the eighth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, forbidding <hi>Stealth,</hi> tho' the ownerſhip came from the act of another Man in its firſt Creation, yet the preſervation of it is from the Law of God, and the Right is as ſtrong in behalf of Succeſſive Monarchy againſt the reſeizure of the People, tho' they cou'd fancy themſelves the firſt Donors and Founders of it, as any Title they have to their proper Goods and Chattels; ay, but ſay they, the caſe is different, for all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is given by the Subjects with a tacit condition, that it ſhall be manag'd to their beſt advantage, and upon failure it may therefore be reaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd; a tacit condition indeed, that was never heard of till the World and Government were ſo many thouſand years old, but to give them one exception to their general rule, it will not hold good in the Government of a Family: And <hi>Lycurgus</hi> who was no Fool, wiſhed ſome <hi>Common-wealth-Statiſts</hi> to make experiment firſt in their own Houſes of that Popular Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del which they were contriving for the <hi>Spartan Nation;</hi> how wou'd it (think you) vex the little <hi>Weſtern Grandee,</hi> if his Wiſe Son and his own Servants ſhou'd attempt to Depoſe him from the management of his Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and Eſtate, by reaſon of his <hi>Male-Adminiſtration</hi> of both, ſince his Head has been ſo full of <hi>Revenge</hi> and <hi>Aſſociation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another miſtake remains more pernicious to the Government than all the reſt, which I have not ſeen fully ſet to rights by any who have argued for the Defendant; it is this, that the Kingſhip of <hi>England</hi> is Elective: There are indeed ſeveral ſuch like Paſſages in our old Chronicles, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for the moſt part by Church-men, who how they came to ſpeak ſo I will anon afford you the grounds, but that chuſing does imply a Power of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing, is againſt the Principle of the Men of <hi>Malmsbury</hi> and of <hi>Geneva</hi> too; who make up the far greateſt number of Adverſaries to our cauſe; for with them Election is neceſſary; ſo that a man cannot chuſe, but he muſt chuſe; and if the ſame ſort of choice, beyond which they claim none, as to the things of God will ſuffice them as to the King, we ſhou'd ſoon be agreed in the preſent Affair. Suitable to this, the <hi>Civilians</hi> ſay a man chuſes when he wiſhes, or when he is not conſtrain'd: Thus the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> choſe a

King, by deſiring one before that <hi>Saul</hi> was appointed by Authority from God, and in congratulatory Joy, when he was anointed, the <hi>People ſhout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, God ſave the King,</hi> and in aſſiſting him againſt thoſe that ſaid, <hi>ſhall</hi> Saul <hi>Reign over us;</hi> and this is as much as can be affirm'd of any Election of our Kings in a peaceable and orderly Coronation, this will manifeſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to you both from the common old form us'd in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> when Kings were Crown'd, as likewiſe from a Parliament-Roll clear and full to the purpoſe; the old form is to be ſeen in the <hi>Ordo Romanus anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quus,</hi> a Book written and us'd above 900 Years ago, the particular Office is Entitled, <hi>The Order for Bleſſing of a King, when he is new rais'd by the Clergy and People to the Kingdom.</hi> In the fourth Prayer theſe Words follow, <hi>Look down upon this thy Servant, whom with ſuppliant Devotion we have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen to be our King;</hi> upon theſe Paſſages at the <hi>Coronation,</hi> it was that the <hi>Church-men-Chroniclers</hi> ſo frequently us'd the Phraſe of <hi>chuſing a King,</hi> but if the reſt of the ſame Office be taken along to explain theſe words, you will ſee that in our common way of ſpeaking about choice, our Kings have no more been choſen by the Subjects, than <hi>Saul</hi> was by the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> for in the firſt and ſecond Prayers, it is ſaid, that <hi>God hath exalted him to the heighth of the Kingdom.</hi> Among the Queſtions propounded by the <hi>Metropolitan</hi> one is, <hi>Wilt thou Govern and defend the Kingdom given thee of God accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the juſtice of thy Fathers,</hi> then the Biſhop turns to the People, will you be ſubject to this Prince and Governor, and <hi>Eſtabliſh his Kingdom with firm faithfulneſs and obey his Commands,</hi> according to the Apoſtles Words, <hi>Let every Soul be ſubject to the higher Powers, to the King as Supream?</hi> then follows the fourth Prayer, in which upon their promiſing to this demand, they are ſaid to chuſe him King, for there is nothing elſe in this Office, in which the People bear a part, ſo that having laid theſe Proceedings im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially before you, I need not induſtriouſly ſhew that the Kingſhip is from God through a Succeſſion, and that the Election of the People is no more than a good liking and Profeſſion of their Allegiance.
